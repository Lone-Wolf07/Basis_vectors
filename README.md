# Made it for ease

As I was reading the book titled *Quantum Computinng for Everyone* by *Chris Bernhardt* He mentioned about representing state vectors in terms of orthonormal basis vectors
Well turns out there is a cool way to do that through algebra manipualtion of matirces inorder to arrive at the coefficents of the Basis vectors 

Now you may ask, but what's the use of measuring the coefficents? 
Well...... The square gives us the probability of measuring the qubit along that basis vector 
Which hey is a pretty big deal

So that got me thinking Why not just AUTOMATE it?
So wrote a small script and it works like a charm 


Now if you have noticed I used the *tkinter* libaray inorder to display messages.....
But why??
Well not just for the asthetics and graphical interface that it offers (tho that is super cool), I am also now able to print out (↑↓) (→←) (↗↙) which required to be printed through their uni code but the print() statement was unable to do that, so yea this works 




PS: Might come back to it just to change the output as into a msg box
